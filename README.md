# Pokémom stats
* ## Intro
  * Pokémon (an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a small team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become the best.    
* ## Objectives 
  *  Each Pokémom has its type, strengths, and weakness, so the purpose of this project is to analyze their statistics. Making graphics and tables, and constructing a model to predict if the Pokémon is legendary!
